# deep-learning-challenge

This repository contains a neural network model used to calculate which applicant has the best chance of success. Our dataset for this model was 34,000 organization data containing metadata about each org. 

First, we preprocessed the data and scaled the training and testing features datasets. After this, we complied and trained the model. Afterwards, we attempted to optimize the model.
